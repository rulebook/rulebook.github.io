<p>Section 1. Penalties Completed
Offsetting Fouls—ARTICLE 4
Approved Ruling 10-1-4
I. On a Team A kickoff, Team B fouls before the untouched ball goes out of bounds between the goal lines. RULING: Offsetting fouls. Team A re-kicks at the previous spot.
II. On a Team A kickoff from its 35-yard line, Team B fouls after the untouched ball goes out of bounds between the goal lines. RULING: Team B may elect a replay with Team A free-kicking at its 45-yard line. If Team B retains the ball, it will be at its 20-yard line, after the 15-yard penalty from its 35-yard line, or 15 yards behind the spot where the five-yard penalty against Team A left the ball (Rules 6-1-8 and 10-1-6).
III. Team A is an illegal formation at the snap. A1’s forward pass is intercepted by B1, who advances five yards and is tackled. Team B clips during B1’s run. RULING: Team B has the option to accept offsetting fouls and repeat the down or to decline offsetting fouls and retain the ball after its penalty is completed. In the latter case Team A may accept or decline the penalty for Team B’s clipping foul.
IV. A1 throws an illegal forward pass and Team B is in the neutral zone at the snap. B23 intercepts the pass and B10 clips on the return. B23 is tackled in the field of play. RULING: No option. The fouls offset and the down is replayed. Team B may not decline offsetting fouls because it had fouled before getting possession of the ball.
V. A1’s forward pass is intercepted by B1, who advances and fumbles. B2 recovers and returns the ball five more yards. Team A fouls during or after the down, and Team B fouls during the fumble or during return by B2. RULING: If Team A’s foul was a live-ball foul, Team B may select offsetting fouls and replay the down or select an option to retain the ball following the completion of the penalty for its foul. If Team A’s foul was a dead-ball foul, Team B retains the ball after enforcement of both penalties.
VI. Team A’s legal forward pass is intercepted by B45, who advances several yards. On the return, B23 clips and A78 tackles B45 by pulling and twisting his face mask. RULING: Since Team B had not fouled before the change of possession, it may decline offsetting fouls and retain possession after completion of the clipping penalty.
VII. A1 receives the snap while standing on his end line. Team B is offside at the snap. RULING: Team A’s foul, out of bounds at the snap, offsets Team B’s offside, and the down is repeated [Note: If Team B had not been offside, Team B could accept the penalty for Team A’s foul or a safety (Rule 8-5-1-a)].
Dead-Ball Fouls—ARTICLE 5
Approved Ruling 10-1-5
I. With fourth and eight, Team A gains four yards and the ball is declared dead, after which B1 is called for piling on. RULING: Team B personal foul. Penalty—15 yards from the succeeding spot. First and 10 for Team B (Rule 5-1-1-c). The clock starts on the snap.
II. A personal foul occurs during action after a snap infraction that was made before the ball was ready for play. RULING: Every effort should be made to prevent any such premature snap and resulting action, but if such a foul does occur, it is between downs. Both penalties are enforced. If the personal foul is by Team B, there is likely a net of 10 yards for Team A. The penalty for Team B’s foul carries an automatic first down.
III. Second and goal at the three-yard line. Ball carrier A14 is downed at the one-yard line and then B67 piles on. A14 retaliates by slugging B67. RULING: The penalties cancel since neither has been completed. A14 is disqualified for fighting. Third and goal (Rule 10-1-1).
Live-Ball—Dead-Ball Fouls—ARTICLE 6
Approved Ruling 10-1-6
I. Team A punts and is illegally in motion at the snap. The untouched ball goes out of bounds between the goal lines, after which Team B commits a personal foul. RULING: Possible options: (1) If Team B elects to replay the down, Team A will be penalized five yards at the previous spot followed by a 15-yard penalty against Team B, which includes an automatic first down. (2) Team B could decline the illegal-motion penalty and have the ball, first and 10 after a 15-yard penalty from the out-of-bounds spot. (3) Team B could accept the five-yard penalty enforced at the out of bounds spot (Rule 6-3-13) followed by the 15-yard penalty against Team B. In all options, the clock starts on the snap (Rule 3-3-2-d-8).
II. Ball carrier B17 at Team A’s 11-yard line taunts pursuing A55 before scoring a touchdown on an intercepted pass. After B17 crosses the goal line, he is tackled by A55 five yards into the end zone. RULING: Unsportsmanlike conduct by B17 and A55. Both penalties are enforced. The penalty for B17’s live-ball foul is enforced at the A-11, and that for the dead-ball foul by A55 is enforced at the succeeding spot. First and 10 for Team B at the A-13.
III. B1 fouls during a down before B2 intercepts a legal forward pass. After the ball is declared dead, A1 piles on. RULING: Team A retains the ball after the penalty against Team B is enforced. Team A then will be penalized for the dead-ball foul (Rule 5-2-3).
IV. Team B is offside on the snap at its three-yard line (not a try) and Team A throws a legal forward pass into Team B’s end zone. Team B intercepts and runs 101 yards to Team A’s end zone, after which Team A clips. RULING: Repeat the down with Team A putting the ball in play at the Team B 16-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-yard line.
No fouls have occurred when Team B intercepts Team A’s legal forward pass. On the runback, a Team B player clips. When the ball becomes dead, a Team A player piles on. RULING: Team B retains possession. Penalize Team B for its clipping foul, followed by a penalty for Team A’s dead-ball foul. The yardages will cancel unless one enforcement spot was inside the 30-yard line and enforcement was toward that goal.
Team A punts and commits a touching violation. B1 clips during the runback of the punt, which is fumbled by B2. A1 recovers the fumble, and A2 fouls after the ball is dead. RULING: Team A has the first option because Team B fouled during the live ball. If Team A declines the penalty for Team B’s foul, Team B will have the ball at the point of the violation, along with the option of accepting enforcement of the penalty for Team A’s dead-ball foul. If Team A accepts the penalty for Team B’s foul, the ball will belong to Team B after enforcement of the penalty for its live-ball foul followed by the penalty against Team A for the dead-ball foul.
Section 2. Enforcement Procedures
Determining the Enforcement Spot and Basic Spot—ARTICLE 2
Approved Ruling 10-2-2

Postscrimmage Kick Enforcement—ARTICLE 3
Approved Ruling 10-2-3
I. Either team fouls during a scrimmage kick after the ball has been touched beyond the neutral zone. The foul is beyond the neutral zone, and Team B will next put the ball in play. RULING: For fouls by Team B, penalty enforcement will be by the Three-and-One Principle with the postscrimmage kick spot as the basic spot (Rule 2-25-11). Team B’s ball, first and 10. For fouls by Team A, penalty enforcement is either from the previous spot or from the spot where the subsequent dead ball belongs to Team B (Rule 6-3-13).
II. Team A’s punt is blocked, crosses the neutral zone and is untouched by Team B beyond the neutral zone. It rebounds behind the neutral zone before Team B clips or holds. The ball is loose at the time of the foul. RULING: The foul is during the kick. If Team B is next to snap the ball, enforcement is according to postscrimmage kick rules.
III. Team A’s punt is blocked behind the neutral zone before clipping or holding by Team B beyond the neutral zone. The ball never crosses the neutral zone during the play. RULING: Rule 10-2-3 applies only when a scrimmage kick crosses the neutral zone. Team A retains possession after the penalty is enforced at the previous spot.
IV. Team A’s successful field goal attempt is snapped at Team B’s 30-yard line, and a Team B player fouls at the 20-yard line during the kick. RULING: Team A may decline the penalty and accept the score or void the score and have Team B penalized at the previous spot (Rule 10-2-5-d).
V. Team A’s untouched, unsuccessful field goal attempt is snapped from Team B’s 30-yard line. Team B fouls at the 15-yard line during the kick. RULING: Team B’s ball.

VI. Team A’s punt crosses the neutral zone. During the kick, B79 holds A55 one yard beyond the neutral zone. B44 catches the kick at the B-25 and returns to the B-40 where he is tackled. RULING: B79’s foul is covered by postscrimmage kick enforcement. The 10-yard penalty is enforced at the end of the kick, which is the B-25. First and 10 for Team B at the B-15.
VII. Team A snaps the ball at the A-35 on fourth and seven. Just after the snap lineman B77 grabs guard A66 and pulls him to one side, allowing linebacker B43 to shoot the gap to try to block the kick.
