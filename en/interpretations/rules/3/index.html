<h2 id="timing-devices-article-4">Timing Devices&ndash;ARTICLE 4</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-2-4">Approved Ruling 3-2-4</h3>

<p>I. When the ball is dead after a running play that ends out of bounds, the 40-second play clock is started.
   The umpire receives the ball from the line judge, and as he is placing it on the ground,
   he sees that it is one of Team B’s balls.
   He tosses the ball to the line judge who attempts to get a Team A ball from the ball boy.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> If the play clock reads 25 or less before the correct ball is in from the sideline and ready for play, the Referee declares a timeout and signals to reset the play clock to 25 seconds.
   When the correct ball is ready for play he signals to start the play clock and the game clock.
II. When the ball is dead after a running play that ends in the side zone,
    the officials have difficulty getting the ball in to the hash mark.
    As the play clock nears 25, the Umpire places the ball on the ground,
    and by the time the officials are ready,
    the play clock is somewhat below 25 when the Umpire steps away.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Without stopping the game clock,
    the Referee gives the “pump” signal to indicate that the play clock is to be reset to 25.
    If the play clock is quickly reset to 25, the game clock does not stop.
    Only if the play clock operator does not quickly respond to the Referee’s “pump” signal will the Referee declare a timeout, signal for the play clock to be set at 25, and then signal to start both the play and game clocks.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-time-for-a-play-after-spiking-the-ball-article-5">Minimum Time For A Play After Spiking The Ball&ndash;ARTICLE 5</h2>

<p>I. Late in a quarter Team A, out of timeouts, makes a first down, stopping the clock which reads 0:03.

   The referee appropriately blows his whistle and signals, which starts the game clock.
   The quarterback takes the snap and raises the ball high over his head before throwing it directly to the ground.
   The game clock shows 0:00.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Time in the quarter has expired.
   Although there were 3 seconds on the game clock when the referee signaled it to start,
   there is no guarantee of enough time to run an additional play other than spiking the ball.
   The offense must execute the spike in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I. On third and 2-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, A45 fumbles a live ball after gaining three yards.

   so the line judge signals the clock to stop while the ball is being located.
   A45 is found to be in possession of the ball and (a) has not made his line to gain or (b) has made his line to gain.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The 40-second clock starts when the ball is declared dead.
   (a) The referee immediately will signal the game clock to start.
   (b) The game clock will start on the referee’s signal when the ball is ready for play.
II. On second and 14, A45 gains six yards and is downed with the ball in his possession.
    The linesman, mistaking the back stake of the line-to-gain chain for the front stake,
    erroneously signals the clock to stop.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> As soon as the error is detected by any official,
    the signal to start the clock shall be given by the game official detecting the error.
III. Team A fumbles or the ball is loose after a backward pass.
     Several players dive on the ball, creating a “pile.”
     <strong>RULING:</strong> The covering official(s) shall stop the clock and the 40-second clock shall start.
     Upon positive knowledge of who recovered,
     the referee will point in the direction governed by possession and start the game clock
     (a) immediately if Team A has recovered short of the line to gain (no first down), or
     (b) on the snap if Team B has recovered.
IV. A shoelace, padlace, jersey, number or equipment breaks or tears.

    A22 (A.R. 3-3- 5-I) attempts to enter the game before the next snap.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> A22 must remain out of the game for at least one play.
    In any event, he may return only on the approval of his team professional medical personnel.
III. B52’s jersey has blood spots on it.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Unless the official determines that the jersey is saturated with blood,
     B52 may remain in the game. (Note: Saturated is defined as soaked with moisture or drenched.

IV. An official notices that blood has soaked through B10’s jersey.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> B10 must leave the game until medical personnel have determined if the jersey must be replaced.
V. B10 tackles A12.
   An official determines that B10’s jersey is saturated with blood from a cut on A12’s arm.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Both players must leave the game—A12 for treatment of his open wound,
   B10 for a determination by medical personnel as to whether he has to replace his jersey.
VI. During a dead-ball interval, A85 notices a bleeding cut on his arm.
    He voluntarily goes to the team area and is replaced by A88.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> This is a legal substitution and there is no variation in game timing.
    A85 may return to the game after the injury has been treated, but he must adhere to substitution rules.

IX. Late in the half ball carrier A35 is tackled beyond the line to gain.

    The game clock starts on the referee’s signal.</p>

<h2 id="helmet-comes-off-timeout-article-9">Helmet Comes Off&ndash;Timeout—ARTICLE 9</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-3-9">Approved Ruling 3-3-9</h3>

<p>I. After the ball is dead, A55 blocks B33 at his waist, knocking him to the ground.
   As B33 hits the ground his helmet comes off.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul by A55, 15-yard penalty from the succeeding spot.
   B33 must leave the game for the next down as his helmet came off through play and not due to a helmet foul.
   B33 may remain in the game if Team B takes a timeout.
II. Late in the first quarter ball carrier A22 is legally tackled,
    and his helmet comes off just after his back hits the ground.
    The game clock reads 0:00.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> A22 must leave the game for the next down, which will be the initial down of the second quarter.
    A22’s helmet came off through play and there was no helmet foul by Team B.
    However, A22 may remain in the game if Team A takes a timeout.
III. During the down A22’s helmet comes off (no helmet foul by the defense) and B77 goes down with an injury.
     The ball carrier is tackled inbounds.
     When the clock is stopped it reads 0:58 in the fourth quarter.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Unless Team A takes a charged timeout, A22 must leave the game for one play.
     The play clock is set at 40 seconds, due to the defensive injury,
     rather than 25 seconds due to the helmet coming off the offensive player.
     There is no option for a 10-second runoff because the clock stops for both the helmet off and the injury,
     and these occur for opposing players.
IV. During the down A22’s helmet comes off (no helmet foul by the defense) and A45 goes down with an injury.
    The ball carrier is tackled inbounds.
    When the clock is stopped it reads 0:58 in the fourth quarter.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Because the injury and the helmet off occur to players on the same team,
    there is an option for a 10-second runoff.
    Team A may keep A22 in the game and also avoid the 10-second runoff by taking one charged timeout.
V. During a play running play that ends in bounds, a linebacker’s helmet comes off.
   When the ball becomes dead the game clock is stopped and reads 0:45 in the second quarter.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The play clock is set at 40 seconds.
   Team A has the option for a 10-second runoff.
   If Team A exercises this option,
   unless Team B is charged with a timeout the game clock is set to 0:35 and starts on the Referee’s signal.
   If Team B uses a timeout to avoid the 10-second runoff,
   the game clock remains at 0:45,
   the play clock is set at 25 and starts on the Referee’s signal,
   and the game clock starts on the snap.</p>

    Team B players are deliberately slow to “unpile” in an obvious attempt to consume time and prevent the officials from making the ball ready for play.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B foul for delay of game.
    Penalty—five yards at the succeeding spot.
    The game clock will start on the snap (Rule 3-4-3).</p>

<h2 id="unfair-clock-tactics-article-3">Unfair Clock Tactics—ARTICLE 3</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-4-3">Approved Ruling 3-4-3</h3>

<p>I. In an attempt to consume time in the fourth period, Team A stalls and the play clock expires.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul for delay of game.
   Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot. The clock starts on the snap.
II. With two minutes remaining in either half and his team with no timeouts remaining,
    B77 crosses the neutral zone and touches a Team A player in an effort to conserve time.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul.
    Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot.
    The clock starts on the ready-for-play signal.
    At his discretion the referee may have the play clock set at 40 seconds.
    Note: If there is less than one minute remaining in the half,
    this foul comes under the 10-second runoff rule (Rule 3-4-4). <!-- TODO: Here, Note NOT emphasized -->
III. A ball carrier, late in the second period, throws a backward pass out of bounds from behind or beyond the neutral zone to conserve time.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Penalty—Five yards from the spot of the foul and loss of down.
    The clock starts on the ready-for-play signal.
    Note: If there is less than one minute remaining in the half,
    this foul comes under the 10-second runoff rule (Rule 3-4-4).
IV. A ball carrier throws a forward pass while beyond the neutral zone to conserve time.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Penalty—Five yards from the spot of the foul and loss of down.
    The clock starts on the ready-for-play signal (Rule 7-3-2 Penalty).
    Note: If there is less than one minute remaining in the half,
    this foul comes under the 10-second runoff rule (Rule 3-4-4).
V. Late in the fourth quarter Team A trails by four points and is driving for a potential score.
   After a running play on which the ball carrier is tackled inbounds,
   Team B players are obviously and deliberately slow in letting him get to his feet or otherwise are employing tactics to delay the officials in making the ball ready for play.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul against Team B, delay of game.
   When the ball is ready for play, the referee will signal the 25-second clock to start,
   and the game clock will start on the snap.
VI. Second and seven at the A-25.
    Team A is ahead in the score late in the second quarter.
    When ball carrier A22 is tackled in the field of play, the game clock reads 1:47.
    The umpire reports to the referee that he has a flag for holding by snapper A55.
    On the play, A22 gained (a) three yards; (b) nine yards.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> After enforcement of the penalty,
    the game clock starts (a) on the snap or on the referee’s signal, at the option of Team B, because the clock stops only to administer the penalty;
    (b) on the referee’s signal, because both administering the penalty and the first down caused the game clock to stop.</p>

<h2 id="10-second-runoff-from-game-clock-foul-article-4">10-Second Runoff From Game Clock&ndash;Foul—ARTICLE 4</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-4-4">Approved Ruling 3-4-4</h3>

<p>I. Second and 10 at the B-30.
   The game clock is running in the second half.
   Team A trails by two points and is out of timeouts.
   After the ball is ready for play lineman A66 commits a false start,
   and when the officials stop the game clock it reads (a) 13 seconds; (b) 8 seconds.
   Team B accepts the yardage penalty and the clock runoff.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) Five-yard penalty with 10 seconds subtracted from the game clock, which is set at 3 seconds.
   Second and 15 at the B-35. The clock starts on the referee’s signal.
   (b) The game is over. Team B wins.
II. Second and 10 at the B-30.
    The game clock is running in the second half.
    Team A trails by two points and is out of timeouts.
    At the snap Team A has five players in the backfield.
    A22 carries for a three-yard gain to the B-27.
    When the ball is declared dead the game clock reads (a) 13 seconds; (b) 8 seconds.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) and (b) Five-yard penalty, illegal formation.
    Second and 15 at the B-35.
    Because the illegal formation is not a foul that causes the clock to stop immediately,
    the 10-second runoff does not apply.
    After the penalty is administered the game clock starts on the referee’s signal.
III. Team A is leading 24-21 with less than one minute in the game and the game clock running.
     With the ball ready for play on third and seven at the B-35,
     tackle B55 jumps across the neutral zone and contacts A77.
     The officials shut the play down with the game clock showing 0:38.
     Team B is out of timeouts.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Offside against Team B.
     Five-yard penalty and a 10-second runoff from the game clock.
     The game clock is set at 0:28. Third and two at the B-30.
     The clock starts on the referee’s signal.
IV. Fourth quarter with the game clock running.
    Second and five at the B-20.
    Tackle B77 is in the neutral zone at the snap, but does not make contact.
    QB A12 rolls out to pass, runs to the B-17 and throws a forward pass, which falls incomplete.
    The game clock reads 0:15.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A illegal forward pass and Team B offside.
    Offsetting fouls. No 10-second runoff.
    Second and 5 at the B-20.
    The game clock remains at 15 seconds and starts on the snap.
V. Fourth quarter with the game clock running and Team A trailing in the score.
   Second and 10 at the B-30.
   Guard A66 in a three-point stance misses the snap count and lurches forward, committing a false start.
   B77 then commits a dead-ball personal foul or a dead-ball foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.
   The game clock is stopped with 8 seconds remaining in the game.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The game is over because Team B will accept the 10-second runoff associated with the false start.
   Thus the penalty for B77’s dead-ball foul is not enforced.
   <em>Note:</em> If this action occurred at the end of the first half the penalty for B77’s foul would carry over to the second half. <!-- TODO: WTF?! in this case, only "Note" is emphasized. -->
   Because of the 10-second runoff, by interpretation the dead-ball foul effectively occurs after the half has ended and thus the penalty is thus carried over.
VI. Second quarter.
    At the snap the game clock reads 0:45. During the play, A55 loses his helmet.
    Right tackle A77 is flagged for holding.
    The ball carrier is tackled inbounds short of the line to gain.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> A55 must leave the game for one play.
    There is no option for a 10-second runoff, because at the end of the play the clock is stopped both for the helmet off and to administer the holding penalty.
    The play clock is set to 25 seconds and the game clock starts on the Referee’s signal. (Rule 3-3-9)
VII. Second quarter.
     Second and 10 at the B-30 with the game clock running.
     Guard A66 in a three-point stance misses the snap count and lurches forward, committing a false start.
     B77 then commits a dead-ball personal foul or a dead-ball foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.
     The game clock is stopped with 8 seconds remaining.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Because of the 10-second subtraction associated with the false start, the half is over.
     The penalty for the Team B dead-ball foul would carry over to the second half.
     Due to the 10-second subtraction, by interpretation the Team B dead-ball foul effectively occurs after the half has ended and the penalty is thus carried over.
     Team A may avoid the 10-second runoff by using an available charged timeout.
     In this case the penalty for the foul by B77 would be enforced,
     giving Team A first and 10 at the B-20 after enforcement of both penalties.</p>

<h1 id="section-5-substitutions">Section 5. Substitutions</h1>

<h2 id="legal-substitutions-article-2">Legal Substitutions—ARTICLE 2</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-5-2">Approved Ruling 3-5-2</h3>

<p>I. Any player(s), in excess of 11, obviously is withdrawing but has not reached a boundary line when the ball is put in play and he does not interfere with play or players.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Live-ball foul. Penalty— Five yards from the previous spot. <!-- TODO: long-dash -->
II. After a change of team possession or any timeout, the ball is declared ready for play.
    When Team A has completed its offensive formation, Team B must promptly position its personnel.
    Team B will be allowed time to complete substitutions.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Either team is subject to a delay-of-game foul—Team B for not completing its substitutions promptly (Rule 3-4-2-b-3) or Team A for causing the 25-second clock to expire.
    Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot.
III. On third down (no change of team possession), ball carrier A27 goes out of bounds or Team A’s legal forward pass falls incomplete.
     During this interval between downs, there is no other referee’s timeout.
     Before the fourth-down snap, substitute B75 enters the game and then departs without remaining in the game for one play.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul. Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot.
IV. Team A has 11 players in the huddle.
    A81 mistakenly thinks he has been replaced and runs to his team area.
    He is immediately sent back onto the field and assumes a position on the line of scrimmage near his sideline.
    The entire team has been stationary for one second before the snap and there has not been a referee’s timeout.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Live-ball foul.
    A player loses his status as a participant when he enters the team area while the ball is dead, and then must adhere to substitution rules.
    Penalty—Five yards from the previous spot,
    or 15 yards from the previous spot if this is judged to be a violation of Rule 9-2-2-b (Rules 3-5-2-d and 9-2-2-b).
V. After the ball is ready for play and the umpire is in his regular position,
   Team A quickly replaces some players with substitutes, gets set for the required one second and snaps the ball.
   The umpire is attempting to get to the ball to allow the defense to match up,
   but he is unable to prevent the snap.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The play is shut down, the game clock is stopped and the defense is allowed to substitute in response to Team A’s late substitutions.
   No foul. The play clock is set to 25 seconds and starts on the ready-for-play signal.
   The game clock starts on the ready-for-play signal or the snap, depending on its condition when play was stopped.
   The referee informs the Team A head coach that any subsequent such actions will result in a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct under Rule 9-2-3.
VI. Between scrimmage downs, one or more Team B substitutes enter the field of play.
    Before the snap for the next down,
    more than 11 Team B players intentionally stay on the field of play as long as possible (over three seconds) to disguise the defensive personnel,
    the type of defense and the pass coverage.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul on Team B, illegal substitution.
    Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot (Rule 3-5-2- c).
VII. After a down that resulted in first and 10 at the B-40, eleven players of Team A, which runs a no-huddle offense, move to their various positions to set for the next play.
     The ball is ready for play when A22 runs onto the field from his team area, and after he pauses the top of the numbers, he or the coaching staff apparently realizes that he is the 12th player.
     A22 then turns and runs back to his team area.
     The ball has not been snapped.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul for a substitution infraction.
     By interpretation A22 has become a player by entering his team’s “effective huddle” and thus must remain in the game for one play.
     Five-yard penalty.
     Team A will have first and 15 at the B-45. (Rule 2-27-9-b)
VIII. Late in the first half Team A is out of timeouts.
      A pass play on third down ends inbounds at the B-25 short of the line to gain with the game clock showing 0:10.
      Facing fourth down and three, Team A immediately hurries its field goal team onto the field.
      <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B should reasonably expect that Team A will attempt a field goal in this situation and should have its field-goal defense unit ready.
      The umpire will not stand over the ball,
      as there should be no issue of the defense being uncertain about the next play.
IX. Late in the first half Team A is out of timeouts.
    A pass play on third down ends inbounds at the B-25 short of the line to gain with the game clock showing 0:30.
    Facing fourth down and three, Team A gives no indication as to its next play until the game clock reads 0:10.
    They then rush their field goal unit onto the field, and Team B then hurries to respond.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> The umpire moves to the ball to prevent the snap until Team B has had a reasonable opportunity to get its field-goal defense unit onto the field.
    The umpire will step away when he judges that the defense has had enough time.
    If the game clock reads 0:00 before the ball is snapped after the umpire steps away, the half is over.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-eleven-players-on-the-field-article-3">More Than Eleven Players on the Field—ARTICLE 3</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-3-5-3">Approved Ruling 3-5-3</h3>

<p>I. A33, an incoming substitute, enters the huddle or assumes a position in a formation and (a) after approximately two seconds, A34 leaves the huddle and departs the field of play at his sideline, or (b) after approximately four seconds, A34 leaves the huddle and departs the field of play at his sideline.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) Legal. (b) Foul.
   (Note: A departing player who leaves the huddle or his position within three seconds is considered to have left immediately.)
II. After the ball is made ready for play,
    substitute B12 enters the huddle or defensive formation and the departing player delays more than three seconds before leaving the huddle or formation and departing the field of play.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Violation of the substitution rule. Dead- ball foul.
    (Note: The referee is not required to warn a departing player to leave the huddle immediately.)
III. Team A has 11 players in its huddle when A27 approaches the huddle (within 10 yards) as it breaks.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul. Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot (Rule 2-27-9-a).
IV. At the end of third down, Team B sends in its kick-return team.
    The responsible officials count the Team B players and are positive that Team B has 12 players on the field of play.
    After approximately four seconds, the officials sound their whistles and drop their penalty markers.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Dead-ball foul, substitution violation. Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot.
V. Team A is in formation to kick a field goal and Team B has eleven players in its formation.
   Just before the ball is snapped a twelfth Team B player runs onto the field.
   The ball is snapped and the kicker completes his kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Live-ball foul. Five-yard penalty, previous spot, or Team A may accept the result of the play.
   Since Team B’s twelfth player had not been in the formation when the ball was snapped, officials should not shut down the play for a dead-ball foul.
   The intent of Rule 3-5-3-b is to give Team B an opportunity to adjust its defense,
   but Team B must not be allowed to gain an advantage by an extra player entering the field very close to the time the ball is snapped.
VI. Team A lines up for a two-point try attempt at the B-3.
    Team B has eleven players in its defensive formation.
    The twelfth Team B player runs onto the field just before or just as the ball is snapped.
    A22 takes the handoff from the quarterback and (a) is tackled at the one-yard line;
    (b) carries the ball into the end zone.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Live-ball foul against Team B for too many players on the field (Rule 1-1-1).
    Officials should not shut the play down.
    (a) Penalize Team B half the distance to the goal and repeat the try at the B-1.5.
    (b) Team A will decline the penalty on the successful try.</p>
