<h1 id="section-1-free-kicks">Section 1. Free Kicks</h1>

<h2 id="free-kick-formation-article-2">Free-Kick Formation—ARTICLE 2</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-1-2">Approved Ruling 6-1-2</h3>

<p>I. The ball is kicked while teed illegally,
   punted on a kickoff or kicked from a spot between the hash mark and the nearer sideline.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Illegal kick.
   Dead-ball foul.
   Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot (Rule 2-16-1-b).
II. Kicker A11 places the ball on the tee in the center of the field for a free kick with four teammates to the left side of the ball and six teammates to the right side of the ball.
    The ball blows off the tee. A55,
    who was lined up to the left of the ball,
    then holds the ball on the tee for right-footed kicker A11.
    No other Team A players move.
    When the ball is kicked by A11, A55 is to the kicker’s right.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by Team A for illegal formation at the kick.
    Penalty—Five yards from the previous spot or five yards from the spot where the subsequent dead ball belongs to Team B.
III. Free-kicker A11 places the ball on the tee just inside the hash mark line on his right.
     All of his teammates line up to his left. At the ready for play,
     four Team A players who were on A11’s left run to their right and are in the area to A11’s right when he kicks the ball.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Legal formation.
IV. A11 places the ball on the tee for a free kick on the 35-yard line in the center of the field.
    A12 lines up near the ball. After the ready for play,
    A11 starts forward as if to kick the ball,
    and A12 suddenly crosses in front of him and kicks the ball.
    When the ball is kicked, A11 is directly behind the ball with three teammates on one side of the ball.
    A12 plants his nonkicking foot on the same side of the ball as his three teammates.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by Team A for illegal formation.
    Penalty—Five yards from the previous spot, and rekick if Team B chooses;
    or five yards from the spot where the subsequent dead ball belongs to Team B.
V. Team A is offside during its free kick. B27 has his knee on the ground when he recovers the kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by Team A for offside.
   The ball is dead at the spot of the recovery.
   Penalty—Team B may choose five yards from the previous spot and another free kick,
   or five yards from the dead-ball spot with a first and 10.
   B27’s recovery started a running play that ended immediately.
   This scenario also would have been valid if B27 had completed a fair catch.
VI. Team A is offside on its free kick and B17 catches the ball at his 15-yard line.
    B17 returns the ball to his 45-yard line where he fumbles.
    A67 recovers at the B-47 and runs to the B-35 where he fumbles,
    with B20 recovering while downed at his 33-yard line.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by Team A for offside.
    Team B may choose to have Team A kick again after a five-yard penalty from the previous spot,
    or Team B may have first and 10 at its 38-yard line.
VII. Team A is in its formation to kick off at the A-35.
     Two players, A33 and A66, are positioned in a four-point stance with their feet on the A-29 and their hands on the A-31.
     The untouched kick hits the ground in Team B’s end zone and is declared dead.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Touchback.
     Team A foul, illegal formation.
     Team B has two options for accepting the penalty:
     Put the ball in play at the B-30,
     after a five-yard penalty at the spot (the B-25) where the dead ball belongs to them;
     or have Team A re-kick at the A-30. (Rule 6-1-8)</p>

<h2 id="free-kick-recovery-article-3">Free-Kick Recovery—ARTICLE 3</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-1-3">Approved Ruling 6-1-3</h3>

<p>I. A33 illegally touches a free kick;
   then he or A44 illegally recovers the kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Illegal touching by both A33 and A44.
   Unless there is an accepted penalty or offsetting fouls,
   Team B may elect to take the ball at any spot of the illegal touching.
II. Team A executes an on-side free kick at the A-35.
    The untouched kick is at the A-43 when A55 blocks B44 above the waist in the front at the A-46.
    A28 muffs the ball at the A-44, and after it rolls to the A-46, A88 blocks B22 at the A-42.
    A20 then recovers the ball at the A-44.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> The block by A55 is a foul and the touching by A28 is illegal,
    because Team A is not eligible to touch the ball since it has not gone 10 yards nor has it been touched by Team B.
    The block by A88 is legal because it occurs after the ball has gone 10 yards.
    Team A is in legal possession of the ball when A20 recovers it at the A-44.
    Team B has two options:
    Decline the penalty for the illegal block and have the ball at the A-44 via the illegal-touching privilege,
    or cancel the illegal-touching privilege by having Team A re-kick from the A-30 after the 5-yard penalty for the block by A55.
    Note that the dead-ball spot, the A-44,
    is not an enforcement spot because the ball does not belong to Team B when the down ends. (Rule 6-1-12)</p>

<h2 id="kicking-team-article-1">Kicking Team—ARTICLE 1</h2>

   and Team A has illegally touched the kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B has four options:
   It may snap the ball at the spot of the illegal touching violation;
   accept a five-yard penalty from the previous spot with Team A kicking from the 30-yard line;
   put the ball in play at the inbounds spot on its 35-yard line;
   or put the ball in play at the inbounds spot five yards from where the ball went out of bounds (Rule 6-1-8).
II. Team A is offside or commits a substitution infraction,
    and the kickoff from the 35-yard line goes out of bounds after it has been touched by Team B.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> For either the offside foul or the substitution foul,
    Team B may elect to have the kick repeated at Team A’s 30-yard line,
    or snap the ball at the inbounds spot five yards from where the ball went out of bounds (Rule 6-1-8).</p>

   It may accept a five-yard penalty at the previous spot with Team A re-kicking from the 30-yard line;

    or putting the ball in play at the inbounds spot either on the 50-yard line or at the inbounds spot 20 yards beyond the spot where the ball went out of bounds.
III. A free kick in flight strikes a Team B player who is in his end zone,
     and the ball then goes out of bounds at the three-yard line.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B’s ball, first and 10, on the three-yard line at the inbounds spot.
IV. Free kick at the A-35.
    B17 leaps from inbounds and is the first player to touch Team A’s free kick when he grasps the ball while airborne.
    He then lands out of bounds with the ball in his control.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Not a foul for free kick out of bounds.
    B17 is inbounds when he touches the kick.

<p>I. Team A illegally touches its kick; then after Team B has touched it, Team A recovers.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Touching by Team A after Team B has touched the kick is legal;
   and, in order to get the ball,
   Team B must take it where Team A illegally touched it.

   the receiving team may play the ball with the assurance that it later may elect the ball at any spot of illegal touching.
II. During a scrimmage kick, A1 commits a touching violation, after which B1 recovers, advances and fumbles.
    A2 recovers the fumble and, during the advance, B2 holds, trips or slugs.

    Because of the illegal touching the penalty for Team B’s foul may be enforced, per Rule 5-2-4.
    The ball belongs to Team B, either at the spot of illegal touching if Team A declines the penalty,
    or at the spot after the enforcement if Team A accepts the penalty (Rule10-2-5-a-2).</p>

   The untouched kick is bouncing at Team B’s three-yard line when A3 blocks B1 into the ball,
   forcing it through the end zone and over the end line.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Touchback.

    A44 recovers at the B-30.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A’s ball, first and 10 at the B-30.

    The game clock starts on the snap.
V. As a punt rolls along the ground A44 blocks B33 into the ball,
   which bounces away and strikes B48 in the leg.

   B57 is head up on right guard A66 while B55 and B78 are in the gaps on A66’s left and right shoulders, respectively.
   After the ball is snapped all three move forward together.
   (a) The three make their primary contact against A66;
   (b) B55 and B57 contact A66, and B78 drives at the right offensive tackle;
   &copy; B57 and B78 make their blocks against A66 but B55 leaps to try to block the kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) Foul. Five-yard penalty.
   If Team A accepts the penalty they will have fourth and two at the B-15.
   (b) and &copy; No foul.
   The action by the Team B players does not involve primary contact against a single player,
   and hence the play is legal.
II. Fourth and four at the B-20.
    Team A is in a formation to attempt a field goal.
    Team A has five players in the backfield.
    Defensive linemen B55, B57, and B78 are shoulder to shoulder.
    B57 is head up on right guard A66 while B55 and B78 are in the gaps on A66’s left and right shoulders, respectively.
    After the ball is snapped all three move forward together.
    The three make their primary contact against A66.
    The holder takes the snap, gets to his feet, and completes a pass to eligible A88 who is tackled at the B-10.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by Team A, illegal formation.
    Foul by Team B, triple team against an offensive lineman.
    The fouls offset and the down is repeated.</p>

<h1 id="section-4-opportunity-to-catch-a-kick">Section 4. Opportunity to Catch a Kick</h1>

<h2 id="interference-with-opportunity-article-1">Interference With Opportunity—ARTICLE 1</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-4-1">Approved Ruling 6-4-1</h3>

<p>I. A Team A player catches a free kick very near receiver B25, thus preventing him from making the catch.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Kick-catch interference.
   Penalty—15 yards from the spot of the foul.
II. A Team B player, about to catch a scrimmage kick,
    is tackled before the ball arrives but catches the kick while he is falling.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Kick-catch interference.
    Penalty—15 yards from the spot of the foul.
    Disqualification of the Team A player if the contact is flagrant.
    If the foul is between the goal lines,
    enforcement is from the spot of the foul and Team B puts the ball in play by a snap;
    if behind Team B’s goal line, award a touchback and penalize from the succeeding spot.
    The ruling would be the same had the kick been muffed or fumbled.
    The ruling also applies on an unsuccessful field goal attempt since Team B touched the ball beyond the neutral zone.
III. While a kick is in flight beyond the neutral zone,
     A1 is standing or running between the ball and B1.
     (a) The ball strikes A1 while B1 is in a position to catch the ball.
     (b) B1, in attempting to catch the ball, bumps into A1.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) and (b) Kick-catch interference.
     Penalty—15 yards at the spot of the foul.
IV. A player of Team B, attempting to catch a kick (no fair catch signal),
    muffs the ball which is then touched by an opponent who was not interfering with the opportunity of the receiver when he was in position to make the catch.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Not interference.
    In the absence of a fair catch signal,
    protection against interference with the opportunity to catch a kick ends when any player of Team B muffs the ball.
V. A Team A player beyond the neutral zone first touches or catches a scrimmage kick that no receiver could have caught while it was in flight.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Illegal touching but not interference.
VI. B25 is standing at the B-35 in position to catch a punt.
    As the ball is on its downward flight A88 runs by B25 very close to his side,
    causing B25 to adjust his position before catching the ball.
    A88 does not make contact and does not penetrate the one-yard area directly in front of B25.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by A88, interference with the opportunity to catch the kick. 15 yards, spot of the foul.
    Even though B25 catches the ball, A88’s action causes him to move away from his original location and thus interferes with his opportunity to make the catch.
VII. B10 signals for a fair catch, muffs the ball and then catches it.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> If B10 has an opportunity to catch the kick after the muff,
     he must be given an unimpeded opportunity to complete the catch.
     If B10 catches the muffed kick, the ball is dead where he first touched it.
VIII. Fourth and 10 at the 50-yard line.
      B17 is at Team B’s 20-yard line and in position to catch Team A’s high scrimmage kick.
      During the downward flight of the ball, A37 contacts B17 viciously and flagrantly before he touches the ball.
      A37 did not alter his speed or make any attempt to elude B17.
      <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A flagrant personal foul, interference with the opportunity to catch a kick.
      Penalty—15 yards from the spot of the foul. A37 is disqualified.
IX. Team A’s ball, fourth and 10 at the 50-yard line.
    Team A’s windblown scrimmage kick is on its downward flight at Team B’s 30-yard line.
    B18, starting at the 20-yard line, must detour around A92 at the 25-yard line to make the catch at the 30-yard line.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by A92 for interference with the opportunity to catch a kick.
    Penalty—15 yards from the spot of the foul, which is the 25-yard line.
X. Punt receiver B44 is standing at his 30-yard line in position to catch the kick. Defender A11 races down the field to cover the punt and reaches a point about a foot directly in front of B44 as the ball descends.
   B44 makes the catch without having to adjust his position or manner of catching the ball because of the presence of A11, who does not pull back to give B44 more room.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul for kick-catch interference. A11 entered the one-yard area directly in front of receiver B44. 15-yard penalty.
XI. Punt receiver B22 is at the B-30 awaiting the punt as it makes its downward flight and his teammate B88 is three yards in front of him at the B-33.
    Down field to cover the kick, A44 legally blocks B88 into B22 just as the ball reaches him.
    The ball hits B22 in the shoulder and bounces away.
    Team A recovers at the B-25.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A’s ball, first and 10 at the B-25. This is not kick-catch interference.
    The action by A44 is against B88 who is not in position to catch the kick, and not against B22.
    Thus A44 is not deemed to have interfered with B22’s opportunity to catch the ball.
    B22’s touching of the ball allows Team A to recover legally.
XII. Fourth and five at the A-30. Punt receiver B22 is in position to catch the kick at the B-30.
     He does not signal.
     A88 is within a yard of B22, at his side,
     but does not make contact with B22 when he catches the kick at the B-30.
     B22 is tackled at the B-32.
     A88’s presence does not cause B22 to make any adjustment to his position or his manner of catching the ball.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Legal play;
     no kick- catch interference.
     A88 is closer than one yard to B22 but is not directly in front of him.
     He does not affect B22’s opportunity to catch the ball. First and 10 for Team B at the B-32.
XIII. B44 is in position to catch a punt at the B-25.
      While the ball is still very high in the air and well before it comes close to B44,
      A88 runs directly in front of B44 within a yard but is not near him when the ball arrives.
      B44 catches the punt and is tackled.
      <strong>RULING:</strong> No foul.
      Although A88 penetrates the one-yard region directly in front of the receiver,
      this is so early in the action that there is no interference with B44’s opportunity to catch the kick.</p>

<h1 id="section-5-fair-catch">Section 5. Fair Catch</h1>

<h2 id="dead-where-caught-article-1">Dead Where Caught—ARTICLE 1</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-5-1">Approved Ruling 6-5-1</h3>

<p>I. After a valid or invalid signal, B1 muffs the punt and B2, who did not signal, catches the kick.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The ball is dead when and where B2 catches it.
II. B1 has a foot out of bounds when he gives a valid or invalid signal.
    He then catches the kick inbounds.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> There is no rule against a receiver going out of bounds during a kick.
    The inbounds catch is legal, and the ball is dead.</p>

<h2 id="no-advance-article-2">No Advance—ARTICLE 2</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-5-2">Approved Ruling 6-5-2</h3>

<p>I. B1 gives a fair catch signal before a muff by B2,
   and then B1 catches or recovers the kick and advances.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Because of B1’s signal the ball is dead where caught or recovered.
   Two steps are permitted to enable B1 to come to a stop or to regain balance.
   A third or subsequent step inbounds is subject to penalty from where the ball is caught or recovered.
   If B1 is tackled, the tackle is disregarded unless deemed unnecessarily rough or is so late that the tackler should know that there was no intention to advance.
   If the kick is caught or recovered by Team B in the end zone,
   it is a touchback. If B1 is tackled before completion of a third step, only the tackler has fouled.
II. Team A punts.
    After signaling for a fair catch on his 20-yard line,
    B1 deliberately lets the ball strike the ground,
    where B2 recovers the bouncing ball and advances to Team B’s 35-yard line.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> The ball is dead at the spot of recovery.
    Advance is illegal.
    Penalty—Five yards from the succeeding spot, the spot of recovery.
    Team B’s ball, first and 10 (Rule 5-2-7).
III. Punt receiver B22 gives an invalid fair catch signal by a brief flick of his upraised hand.
     He catches the ball at the B-35 and sprints to the B-40 where he is tackled.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> The ball is dead where caught.
     Foul for delay of game by B22; five-yard penalty from the dead-ball spot.
     No foul by the tackler, as clearly B22 gave the appearance of being a ball carrier.
     First and 10 for Team B at the B-30.</p>

<h2 id="invalid-signals-article-3">Invalid Signals—ARTICLE 3</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-5-3">Approved Ruling 6-5-3</h3>

<p>I. A1 or B1 signals for a fair catch beyond the neutral zone during a kick that does not cross the neutral zone.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Any signal by Team A is ignored.
   Team B may not make a fair catch signal because the ball did not cross the neutral zone.
   However, the ball is dead when caught or recovered (Rules 2-8-1-a and 4-1-3-g).
II. On a free kick, B17 makes an invalid signal for fair catch near the sideline, muffs the ball, and it goes out of bounds.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B’s ball, first and 10 at the hash mark.
III. A scrimmage kick strikes the ground beyond the neutral zone and bounces high into the air,
     and B1 signals for a fair catch.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Invalid signal. The ball is dead when recovered.
IV. B1 catches a scrimmage kick beyond the neutral zone and then signals for a fair catch.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Invalid signal. The ball is dead where the signal first was given.
V. Team A’s scrimmage kick is rolling beyond the neutral zone when B17 alerts his teammates to stay away from the ball by a “get away” signal.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Invalid signal. The ball is dead by rule when either team recovers.</p>

<h2 id="illegal-block-or-contact-article-4">Illegal Block or Contact—ARTICLE 4</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-5-4">Approved Ruling 6-5-4</h3>

<p>I. B1 gives either a valid or invalid fair catch signal and does not touch a punt.
   While the untouched ball is loose in the field of play,
   he blocks an opponent (a) in the field of play beyond the neutral zone or (b) in Team B’s end zone.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> (a) If the ball crosses the neutral zone and Team B has possession when the down ends,
   Team B is penalized 15 yards from the postscrimmage kick enforcement spot.
   (b) Safety. The ruling is the same on an unsuccessful field goal attempt.
II. B1 signals at the 50-yard line and does not touch a punt.
    While the ball is rolling on the ground at Team B’s 45-yard line,
    B1 illegally uses his hands in an attempt to get to the ball,
    and the ball is declared dead in Team B’s possession.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Penalty—15 yards, postscrimmage kick enforcement.
    The ball belongs to Team B (Rule 10-2-3).</p>

<h2 id="no-tackling-article-5">No Tackling—ARTICLE 5</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-6-5-5">Approved Ruling 6-5-5</h3>

<p>I. B1 and B2 each signal.
   B1 muffs, and B2 is about to catch the muffed ball when A1 grabs and pulls him to the ground.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Not interference, but holding.
   Penalty—10 yards from the previous spot or from the spot where the subsequent dead ball belongs to Team B.
II. B22 makes a fair catch and is tackled before he has carried the ball more than two steps.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by the tackler. Penalty—15 yards from the succeeding spot.
III. B1 catches the punt after B3 signals for a fair catch.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> The ball is dead when and where caught.
     B1 is not entitled to catch protection but is entitled to the same protection he has after any other dead ball (Rule 6-5-1-d).</p>
