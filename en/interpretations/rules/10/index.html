    Team B fouls after the untouched ball goes out of bounds between the goal lines.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team B may elect a replay with Team A free-kicking at its 45-yard line.
    If Team B retains the ball, it will be at its 20-yard line,
    after the 15-yard penalty from its 35-yard line,
    or 15 yards behind the spot where the five-yard penalty against Team A left the ball (Rules 6-1-8 and 10-1-6).
III. Team A is an illegal formation at the snap.

     Team B is offside at the snap.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A’s foul, out of bounds at the snap,

   The yardages will cancel unless one enforcement spot was inside the 30-yard line and enforcement was toward that goal.
VI. Team A punts and commits a touching violation.
    B1 clips during the runback of the punt, which is fumbled by B2.
    A1 recovers the fumble, and A2 fouls after the ball is dead.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Team A has the first option because Team B fouled during the live ball.
    If Team A declines the penalty for Team B’s foul,
    Team B will have the ball at the point of the violation,
    along with the option of accepting enforcement of the penalty for Team A’s dead-ball foul.
    If Team A accepts the penalty for Team B’s foul,
    the ball will belong to Team B after enforcement of the penalty for its live-ball foul followed by the penalty against Team A for the dead-ball foul.</p>
