<h1 id="section-3-the-ball">Section 3. The Ball</h1>

<h2 id="administration-and-enforcement-article-2">Administration and Enforcement—ARTICLE 2</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-3-2">Approved Ruling 1-3-2</h3>

<p>I. On fourth down, kicker A1 enters the field with an approved game ball and asks the referee to substitute it for the ball used during the previous down.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Substitution of the ball is not permitted.</p>

<h1 id="section-4-players-and-playing-equipment">Section 4. Players and Playing Equipment</h1>

<h2 id="players-numbering-article-2">Players’ Numbering—ARTICLE 2</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-4-2">Approved Ruling 1-4-2</h3>

<p>I. The Team A player who started the game wearing jersey number 77 enters the game wearing number 88.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The player must report to the Referee who,
   without stopping the game or play clock,
   uses his microphone to announce the change and the relevant flank official informs the opposing head coach.
   If A88 fails to report it is a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

<h2 id="specifications-mandatory-equipment-article-4">Specifications: Mandatory Equipment—ARTICLE 4</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-4-4">Approved Ruling 1-4-4</h3>

<p>I. A player or players of a team wear(s) tights (with stirrups) that cover their legs.
   <strong>RULING:</strong>* Legal.
   All other squad members of this team also must wear tights or knee-length socks of the same color.
   All squad members of a team must wear socks or leg coverings that are identical in color and design.
   All squad members of a team may wear short socks of the same color and design.</p>

<h2 id="jersey-design-color-and-numerals-article-5">Jersey Design, Color and Numerals—ARTICLE 5</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-4-5">Approved Ruling 1-4-5</h3>

<p>I. The home team is wearing red jerseys with orange numerals.
   In the judgment of the officials,
   the numerals and the body of the jersey do not contrast enough to make the numbers readily visible.
   The referee asks the home team head coach to change to a legal jersey.
   The head coach tells the referee that his team will not change into different jerseys.
   The referee informs the head coach that his team will be charged a timeout at the beginning of each quarter that the illegal jerseys are worn.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> After the ball is marked ready for play for the opening kickoff,
   the referee charges the home team with a timeout for illegal equipment.
   For each quarter that they continue to wear the jerseys,
   the team is charged with a timeout after the ball is declared ready for play and before the ball is put in play for the first play of that quarter.</p>

<h2 id="illegal-equipment-article-7">Illegal Equipment—ARTICLE 7</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-4-7">Approved Ruling 1-4-7</h3>

<p>I. A33 is wearing a bandanna under his helmet,
   with part of the bandanna protruding from underneath the back of the helmet.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> Illegal equipment.
   Bandannas may be worn under the helmet as long as no part of the bandanna is visible when the helmet is in place.
   The visible bandanna is considered a uniform attachment (1-4-7-h).
   A33 must leave the game for at least one down and may not returned until the bandanna is removed or completely hidden under the helmet.
   Team A may request a team timeout, if one is available, to prevent A33 from missing a down,
   but the bandanna must be hidden or removed.
II. At the end of a down, B55’s shoulder pad has become exposed and is not covered by the jersey.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Illegal equipment.
    Because the pad became exposed through play, B55 is not required to leave the game.
    The pad must be covered by the jersey before the ball is next put into play.
III. Both teams come onto the field before the game wearing colored jerseys.
     The visiting team has not obtained written agreement from the home team to wear other than white jerseys,
     or if such agreement has been obtained the home team’s conference has not certified that the jerseys are of contrasting colors.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> Foul by the visiting team for violation of the jersey-color rule.
     A 15-yard penalty will be assessed at the succeeding spot after the ball is dead following the opening kickoff of each half.
     If the opening kickoff of a half is returned for a touchdown,
     the 15-yard penalty is assessed either on the try or the kickoff. (1-4-5-b)
IV. As Team A is about to break its huddle, the Referee notices that A35 is wearing an overbuilt facemask.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> A35 must leave the game for one down to get a legal facemask.
    Team A may use an available charged timeout in order that A35 not miss a down,
    but he may not play with the illegal facemask.
V. Each member of the offensive line is wearing a towel,
   all of which are white, 4” by 12”, with a small team logo.
   The snapper’s towel also has a large skull-and-cross-bones symbol.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> It is legal for any player to wear a towel.
   The towels are all legal except the snapper’s.
   He must leave the game for at least one down and may not return until the towel is removed or replaced with one that is legal.
   Team A may keep him in the game by using a charged timeout, but he may not wear the illegal towel.
   (Rules 1-4-6-a and 1-4-8)</p>

<h2 id="mandatory-and-illegal-equipment-enforcement-article-8">Mandatory and Illegal Equipment Enforcement—ARTICLE 8</h2>

<h3 id="approved-ruling-1-4-8">Approved Ruling 1-4-8</h3>

<p>I. After the ball is ready for play, an official identifies a player(s) who is obviously not wearing a mouthpiece.
   <strong>RULING:</strong> The player(s) must leave the game for at least one down and may not return until properly equipped with a mouthpiece.
   The player(s) may remain in the game by spending an available team timeout,
   but they may not play until properly equipped.
II. Late in the first half, Team B has used its three timeouts.
    At the end of a play the line judge notices that B44,
    a player who participated in the previous play,
    is equipped with an eye shield that is either tinted or not clear.
    <strong>RULING:</strong> Equipment violation.
    B44 must leave the game for at least one down and may not return if he is wearing an illegal eye shield.
III. When the ball is dead after a scrimmage down,
     the Umpire notices that linebacker B55 has an exposed back pad at waist level,
     which apparently became exposed through play during the previous down.
     <strong>RULING:</strong> B55 is not required to leave the game,
     but he must cover the exposed pad with his jersey before the next down.</p>
