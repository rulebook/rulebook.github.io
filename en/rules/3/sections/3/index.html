<p>An official shall signal timeout when the rules provide for
stopping the clock or when a timeout is charged to a team or to the referee.
Other officials should repeat timeout signals. The referee may declare
and charge himself with a discretionary timeout for any contingency not
elsewhere covered by the rules (A.R. 3-3-1-IV).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a team’s charged timeouts are exhausted and it requests a
timeout, the officials shall not acknowledge the request. (Rule 3-3-4).</p>

<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p><em>Free Kick.</em> After the ball is free-kicked, the game clock shall
be started on an official’s signal when the ball is legally touched in the field
of play, or when it crosses the goal line after being touched legally by Team
B in its end zone. It is subsequently stopped on an official’s signal when the
ball is dead by rule. (A. R. 3-3-2-VII)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scrimmage Down.</em> When a period begins with a scrimmage down, the
game clock shall be started when the ball is legally snapped. On all
other scrimmage downs, the game clock shall be started when the ball
is legally snapped (Rule 3-3-2-d) or on a prior signal by the referee
(Rule 3-3-2-e). The game clock shall not run during a try, during an
extension of a period or during an extra period (A.R. 3-3-2-I-IV).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>After a Score.</em> The game clock shall stop on an official’s signal after a
touchdown, field goal or safety. It shall be started again as in (a) above unless an accepted penalty erases the score, in which case it shall be
started when the ball is legally snapped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starts on the Snap. For each of the following, the game clock is stopped
on an official’s signal. If the next play begins with a snap, the game clock will start on the snap:</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Touchback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With fewer than two minutes remaining in a half a Team A ball
carrier, fumble or backward pass is ruled out of bounds. (Exception: After a Team A forward fumble, the clock starts on the referee’s signal.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team B is awarded a first down and will next snap the ball (A.R. 3-3-2-V).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A forward pass is ruled incomplete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A team is granted a charged timeout.</p>

<li>
<p>Starts on the Referee’s Signal. For each of the following reasons, the game clock is stopped on an official’s signal. If the next play begins with a snap, the game clock will start on the referee’s signal:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Team A is awarded a first down, either through play or by penalty. 2. A Team A forward fumble goes out of bounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than with fewer than two minutes remaining in a half, a Team A ball carrier, fumble or backward pass is ruled out of bounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To complete a penalty (Exception: Rule 3-4-4-c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An injury timeout is allowed for one or more players or an official
(A.R. 3-3-5-I-V).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inadvertent whistle is sounded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A possible first-down measurement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A delay in making the ball ready for play is caused by both teams
(A.R. 3-3-1-III).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A live ball comes into possession of an official.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A head coach’s conference or instant-replay challenge is requested. 11. The referee grants a media timeout.</p>

<p>Snap Supercedes Referee’s Signal. Whenever one or more incidents that cause the game clock to be started on the referee’s signal (Rule 3-3-2-e) occur in conjunction with any that cause it to be started on the snap (Rules 3-3-2-c and 3-3-2-d), it shall be started on the snap.

<p>The referee may suspend the game temporarily when conditions warrant such action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the game is stopped by actions of a person(s) not subject to the
rules or for any other reasons not in the rules and cannot continue, the referee shall:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Suspend play and direct the players to their team areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer the problem to those responsible for the game’s management. 3. Resume the game when he determines conditions are satisfactory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a game is suspended under Rules 3-3-3-a and b before the end of the fourth period and cannot be resumed, there are four possible options:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Resume the game at a later date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminate the game with a determined final score;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forfeit of the game; or 4. Declare a no contest.
The option that takes effect shall be determined by conference policy if both institutions are members of the same conference. In non- conference competition, the directors of athletics at the participating institutions or their designees, in consultation with the coaches, must agree on one of the four options. This agreement will include the final score if the game is terminated (Rule 8-1-2).
In the event that the directors of athletics do not reach an agreement, the conference policy of the home team shall be used to determine the outcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a game is suspended under Rules 3-3-3-a and b after four periods of play and cannot be resumed, the game shall be ruled a tie. The final score shall be the score at the end of the last completed period. (Note: If a winner must be determined in a conference playoff game, conference policy shall determine when and where the game will be resumed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A suspended game, if resumed, will begin with the same time remaining and under the identical conditions of down, distance, field position and player eligibility.

<p>A player, incoming substitute or head coach may request a head
coach’s conference with the referee, if the coach believes a rule has been enforced improperly. If the rule enforcement is not changed, the coach’s team will be charged a timeout, or a delay penalty if all timeouts have been used.</p>

<p>For live-televised games only, a charged team timeout shall be 30
seconds plus the 25-second play clock interval.
However, the head coach may request that one of the allowed three timeouts in each half be a full timeout. This request should be communicated to the referee when the timeout request is made to the officials. The charged team timeout during an extra period (Rule 3-1- 3-h) may be a full timeout, at the request of the head coach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other than live-televised games, the head coach may request that any charged team timeout be 30 seconds in duration, plus the 25-second play clock interval. The head coach indicates this request visually by touching his hands to his shoulders. The signal must be made promptly after the timeout is requested.</p>

<li>
<p>Other timeouts shall be not longer than the referee deems necessary to fulfill the purpose for which they are declared, including a radio or TV timeout, but any timeout may be extended by the referee for the benefit of an injured player (Refer to Appendix A for the guidelines for game officials to use during a serious on-field player injury).</p>

<p>If a player’s helmet comes completely off through play, other than as the direct result of a foul by an opponent, the player must leave the game for the next down. The game clock will stop at the end of the down. The player may remain in the game if his team is granted a charged timeout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the helmet coming off is the only reason for stopping the clock, other than due to an injury to the player or his teammate (Rule 3-3-5), the following conditions apply (A.R. 3-3-9-I-III):</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The play clock will be set at 25 seconds if the player is on offense and at 40 seconds if the player is on defense. With one minute or more remaining in either half, the game clock will start on the referee’s signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is less than one minute in the half the opponent has the option of a 10-second runoff, unless the helmet comes off as the direct result of a foul by the opponent.</p>

<p>There is no option for a 10-second runoff if helmets come off opposing players. (A.R. 3-3-9-V)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ball carrier’s helmet comes off as in paragraph a (above) the ball is dead (Rule 4-1-3-q). If the player is not the ball carrier the ball remains alive, but he must not continue to participate in the play beyond the imme-diate action in which he is engaged. Prolonged participation is a personal foul (Rule 9-1-17). By definition such a player is obviously out of the play (Rule 9-1-12-b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player who intentionally removes his helmet during the down commits a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct (Rule 9-2-1-a-1-i).</p>
