&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Pregame Warmup. Prior to regular season games, teams must have access to the field for pregame warm-ups until at least 22 minutes before the opening kickoff.

Before the second half, the referee will obtain the teams’ second-half options.
d.  During the coin toss, each team shall remain in the area between the nine-yard marks and its sideline or in the team area. The coin toss begins when the field captains leave the nine-yard marks and ends when the captains return to the nine-yard marks.
PENALTY [d[—Five yards from the succeeding spot [S19].
e.  The winner of the toss shall choose one of the following options:
1.  To designate which team shall kick off.

3.  To defer his selection to the second half.

h. For the second half the loser of the toss, or the winner who chooses option 3 above, shall choose option 1 or 2 above. The opponent then chooses the remaining available option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second and Fourth Periods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the first and second periods and also between the third and fourth periods, the teams shall defend opposite goal lines.
a.  The ball shall be relocated at a spot corresponding exactly, in relation to goal lines and sidelines, to its location at the end of the preceding period.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Ball Becomes Alive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a dead ball is ready for play, it becomes a live ball when it is legally snapped or legally free-kicked. A ball snapped or free-kicked before it is ready for play remains dead (A.R. 2-16-4-I, A.R. 4-1-4-I and II, A.R. 7-1-3-IV, and A.R. 7-1-5-I and II).
Live Ball Becomes Dead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. A live ball becomes a dead ball as provided in the rules or when an official sounds his whistle (even though inadvertently) or otherwise signals the ball dead (A.R. 4-2-1-II and A.R. 4-2-4-I).
b. If an official sounds his whistle inadvertently or otherwise signals the ball dead during a down (Rules 4-1-3-k, m and n):
1. When the ball is in player possession, then the team in possession may elect to put the ball in play where declared dead or repeat the down.
2.  When the ball is loose from a fumble, backward pass or illegal pass, then the team in possession may elect to put the ball in play where possession was lost or repeat the down (Exception: Rule 12).
3.  During a legal forward pass or a free or scrimmage kick, then the ball is returned to the previous spot and the down repeated (Exception: Rule 12).
4.  After Team B gains possession on the try or during an extra period, then the try is over or the extra-period possession series is ended.
c.  If a foul or violation occurs during any of the above downs, the penalty or violation privilege shall be administered as in any other play situation if not in conflict with other rules (A.R. 4-1-2-I and II).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ball Declared Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A live ball becomes dead and an official shall sound his whistle or declare it dead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a.  When it goes out of bounds other than a kick that scores a field goal after touching the uprights or crossbar; when a ball carrier is out of bounds;
or when a ball carrier is so held that his forward progress is stopped. When in question, the ball is dead (A.R. 4-2-1-II).
b.  When any part of the ball carrier’s body, except his hand or foot, touches the ground or when the ball carrier is tackled or otherwise falls and loses possession of the ball as he contacts[…]&lt;/p&gt;
