Targeting and Making Forcible Contact With
the Crown of the Helmet—ARTICLE 3
Approved Ruling 9-1-3
I. Passer A12 inside the tackle box is looking for an open receiver.
Before or just as he releases the ball, A12 is hit from the side at the ribs, thigh or knee by B79, who dives forward and leads with the crown (top) of his helmet. This occurs in the (a) first half; (b) second half. RULING: Foul by B79 for targeting his opponent and initiating contact with the top of his helmet. 15 yards, first down. B79 is automatically disqualified (a) for the remainder of the game. (b) for the remainder of the game and the first half of the next game.
Targeting and Making Forcible Contact to Head or
Neck Area of a Defenseless Player—ARTICLE 4
Approved Ruling 9-1-4
I. Receiver A83 has just leaped and received a forward pass. As A83 is
about to regain his balance, B45 launches and drives into A83 above the shoulder area with his helmet or shoulder. This occurs in the (a) first half; (b) second half. RULING: Foul by B45 for targeting and initiating contact with a defenseless opponent above the shoulders. 15 yards, first down. B45 is automatically disqualified (a) for the remainder of the game. (b) for the remainder of the game and the first half of the next game.
II. As ball carrier A20 sweeps around the end and heads upfield, he lowers his head and contacts defensive end B89 who is trying to tackle him. The players meet helmet to helmet. RULING: No foul. Neither A20 nor B89 is a defenseless player and neither has targeted his opponent in the sense of Rule 9-1-3.
III. A44 is covering the kickoff that opens the second half. As A44 is running at the Team B 45-yard line, B66 targets and launches into A44 from the side, a blind-side block. B66 first makes contact with his forearm at A44’s (a) neck; (b) upper arm or shoulder. RULING: (a) Foul by B66 for targeting a defenseless player and initiating contact at the head or neck area. 15-yard penalty at the end of the run. B66 is disqualified for the remainder of the game and the first half of the next game. (b) No foul. Although A44 is a defenseless player and B66 targets him, the contact by B66 is not to the head or neck area. (Rule 2-27-14)
IV. A12 who normally plays quarterback is lined up as a wide receiver in the backfield and A33 is five yards behind the snapper in a shotgun formation. A33’s pass intended for A12 is intercepted. During the interception return B55 targets and launches at A33, striking him in the side of the helmet. RULING: Foul by B55 for targeting and initiating contact at the head of a defenseless player. For purposes of Rule 2-27-14, A33 is a defenseless player since he played the down in the role of the quarterback.
V. End A81 is split far to the left of the formation, to the outside of defensive end B89. On a sweep play in B89’s direction he moves to his left to focus on the ball carrier, losing sight of A81. A81 then cuts to the inside, takes aim and launches at B89, forcibly contacting him with his forearm to B89’s neck. RULING: Targeting foul under Rule 9-1-4, 15 yard penalty, A81 is disqualified. B89 is a defenseless player as he is subject to the blind-side block. (Rule 2-27-14)
VI. Ball carrier A33 has gained several yards and is in the grasp of two defenders. His forward progress been stopped but the ball has not been declared dead. Linebacker B55 crouches and thrusts himself forward, driving his forearm into the side of A33’s helmet. RULING: Targeting foul by B55. 15 yard penalty, B55 is disqualified. A33 is a defenseless player since he is in the grasp of the opponents and his forward progress has been stopped. (Rule 2-27-14)
VII. Pass receiver A88 has just caught the ball when defender B55 launches and drives his shoulder and forearm into his upper body. The back judge flags B55 for targeting to the head-neck area and he is disqualified. The referee makes his announcement of the targeting foul, and the play goes to review. RULING: After review, Instant Replay rules that there was not forcible contact to the head-neck area, overturning the disqualification of B55. The referee announces that B55 is not disqualified and that there will be no 15-yard penalty.
VIII. Punt receiver B44 is in position to catch a punt. Gunner A88 races down the field and launches at B44, driving the side of his helmet IX.
and shoulder into B44’s upper body the instant before the ball arrives. The side judge and field judge throw their flags and report to the referee that A88 is charged with kick-catch interference and targeting to the head-neck area. The referee makes his announcement of kick-catch interference with targeting to the head-neck area. The play goes to review. RULING: After review, Instant Replay rules that A88 did not make forcible contact to the head-neck area, overturning his disqualification. The referee announces that A88 is not disqualified and that the 15-yard penalty for interference with the opportunity to catch a kick will be enforced.
IX. In a game without instant replay, the conference or teams have agreed to use the halftime review process for first-half targeting fouls. During the first quarter, pass receiver A88 has just caught the ball when defender B55 launches and drives his shoulder and forearm into his upper body. The back judge flags B55 for targeting to the head-neck area. The referee makes his announcement of the targeting foul and that B55 is disqualified. RULING: In the halftime review of the video, the referee and the crew determine that B55 did not make forcible contact to A88’s head-neck area, overturning his disqualification. The referee informs both head coaches that B55 may return to the game in the second half. Before the kickoff for the second half, the referee announces to the stadium that after review, the disqualification of B55 is overturned and he may return to the game for the second half.
X. On a punt return, B44 launches at A66 from the blind side and drives his shoulder into him. The force of the contact is at A66’s side below the shoulder. RULING: Legal block. A66 is a defenseless player because B44 executes a blind-side block. However, this is not a targeting foul because the forcible contact is not to the head/neck area.</p>

<pre><code>           Blocking Below the Waist—ARTICLE 6
</code></pre>

<p>Approved Ruling 9-1-6
I. A1, an end, is positioned 11 yards to the left of the snapper at the snap. B2 is between the original position of A1 and the sideline. A1 blocks B2 away from the position of the ball at the snap. The block by A1 is below the waist and directly in front of B2. RULING: Legal block because it is directly at the opponent’s front.
II. Quarterback A1 is forced to run out of his protecting pocket, leave the tackle box, and scramble back and forth across the field. A2, a wide receiver positioned 12 yards to the left of the snapper at the snap, moves downfield and then returns toward the neutral zone. A2 blocks B2 below the waist clearly from the side. RULING: Illegal block below the waist since it is not at the front. 15-yard penalty.
III. On a run or pass option play, wide receiver A2 at the snap is positioned 12 yards to the right of the snapper. He moves downfield and then returns toward the neutral zone. The ball has left the tackle box when A2 blocks B2 below the waist in the 10-to-2 region directly at B2’s front and slightly toward Team A’s end line. RULING: Illegal block below the waist. Even though A2 blocks below the waist directly at the front, the block is toward his own end line.15-yard penalty.
IV. At the snap A82 is positioned on the line of scrimmage to the right side of the formation, 10 yards from the snapper. Back A31, a flanker positioned to the left side of the formation, runs a deep reverse to the right side after receiving the ball from a teammate. As the play develops A82 blocks linebacker B62 toward the line through the original position of the ball. The block by A82 is below the waist and directly at the front, clearly inside the “10 o’clock to 2 o’clock” width. The block occurs (a) before ball carrier A31 has reached the line of scrimmage; (b) after ball carrier A31 is clearly beyond the neutral zone. RULING: (a) Illegal crackback block. The block below the waist is directed toward the line through the original position of the ball before it has crossed the neutral zone. 15-yard penalty. (b) Legal play. The crackback block is allowed once the ball carrier is beyond the neutral zone.
V. Back A41 is stationary at the snap directly behind the right tackle in a balanced line formation. His left shoulder is inside the tackle box. The quarterback hands the ball to back A22 who runs straight ahead. A41 blocks B2 who moves into the offensive backfield to make a play on the ball carrier before A22 reaches the line of scrimmage. The block is below the waist and clearly at the side. RULING: Legal block. A41 is partially inside the tackle box and behind the second lineman at the snap, and at the time of the block the ball had not left the tackle box.
VI. Defensive end B88 blocks below the waist against tackle A75 one yard beyond the line of scrimmage. The block is at the opponent’s side. RULING: Legal block because it takes place within the 10-yard belt. Had this block taken place more than five yards from the line of scrimmage in either direction it would be a foul.
VII. Back A22 is stationary inside the tackle box at the snap. After the snap he shoots between the tackle and the guard on his side, crosses into Team B’s secondary and blocks low on linebacker B55 before the ball has left the tackle box. The contact is at B55’s thigh from the side and is directed straight ahead of A22. RULING: Illegal block below the waist. Since A22 leaves the tackle box before making the block, he is restricted from blocking other than with a “10-2” block. 15-yard penalty.
VIII. Third and seven at the A-30. The ball is at the left hash mark. Back A22 is split completely outside the frame of the tackle on the left side, and B40 moves out to cover him. The handoff goes to back A44 who sweeps around the right end. As the play develops B40 follows the play and A22 chases him. At the A-40 beyond the right hash mark A22 overtakes B40 and blocks him below the waist clearly and directly at the front (10-to-2). The direction of this block is downfield and slightly toward the right sideline. A44 is tackled at the B-45. RULING: Legal play. The block made directly in front of the opponent is legal, since it is not toward Team A’s end line and the ball is beyond the neutral zone.
IX.
X.
First and 10 at the A-40. A12 takes the snap and starts on a sweep to his right. Guard A66 pulls and leads the play. As the play develops linebacker B55 blocks A66 from the side at the thigh at the A-44. A12 is driven out of bounds at the A-48. RULING: No foul. B55’s block below the waist is legal because it occurs fewer than 5 yards beyond the neutral zone.
At the snap tight end A85 is aligned six yards from the snapper. Before the ball has left the tackle box, A85 blocks tackle B77 below the waist at the side. RULING: Illegal block below the waist. A85 is outside the tackle box at the snap, so he may block below the waist only within the 10-2 region. 15-yard penalty.
              Late Hit, Action Out of Bounds—ARTICLE 7
Approved Ruling 9-1-7
I. After the ball is dead, a player throws himself onto an opponent lying on the ground. RULING: Personal foul. Penalty—15 yards from the succeeding spot and first down if by a Team B player and not in conflict with other rules. “Piling on’’ applies to a ball carrier or to any other opponent who is prostrate when the ball becomes dead.
II. On a sweep play toward the sideline, linebacker B55 goes out of bounds to avoid a block. Guard A66 is leading the play, and just as he steps on the sideline with his front foot he drives his shoulder in the waist at the front of B55 who is still out of bounds. RULING: Legal block. A66 does not have both feet out of bounds.
Roughing the Passer—ARTICLE 9
Approved Ruling 9-1-9
I. After passer A17 releases the ball, B68 takes two strides and charges into A17, showing no attempt to avoid contact. RULING: Roughing the passer. The passer is a defenseless player who is vulnerable to injury and must be fully protected. After taking two strides, B68 should be aware that A17 has released the ball and be able to avoid contacting him.
II. Quarterback A11 drops back in the pocket and sets up to pass. Just as he releases the ball he is hit by end B88 who drives his shoulder into A11’s knee. The pass is (a) incomplete; (b) caught by A44 who is tackled after a 12-yard gain to the B-40. RULING: Foul by B88 for forcibly hitting the passer at the knee or below, in violation of Rule 9-1-9-b. Automatic first down and 15-yard penalty enforced at (a) the previous spot; (b) at the B-40, the end of the run by A44.
III. Quarterback A11 drops back in the pocket and sets up to pass. He then scrambles to his right, sets up again and is in the passing posture when he is hit by end B88 who drives his shoulder into A11’s knee. A11 then pulls the ball in and goes to the ground because of being tackled by B88. RULING: Foul by B88, violation of Rule 9-1-9-b. While A11 is technically not a passer because he did not release the ball, the action by B88 is a foul under 9-1- 9-b because of the vulnerability of A11 as a potential passer in a passing posture.</p>

<p>Chop Blocking—ARTICLE 10
Approved Ruling 9-1-10
I. On a forward pass play, A75 is blocking B66 at the waist behind the neutral zone. While A75 maintains contact, A47 subsequently blocks B66 at his thigh. RULING: Chop block, 15 yards from the previous spot.
II. As the flow of the play moves to the left, right tackle A77 is disengaging from his block above the thigh with B50 when A27 blocks B50 at his knee. RULING: Chop block, 15 yards. Previous- spot enforcement if the foul occurs behind the neutral zone.
III. Immediately after the snap, left guard A65 and left tackle A79 simultaneously block B66, who is in the neutral zone. (a) Both blocks are at the thigh. (b) One contact is at the waist and the other at the knee. RULING: (a) Legal blocks for a low-low combination. (b) Foul, chop block.
IV. Tight end A87 and wingback A43 are leading the play when both simultaneously block linebacker B17, who is three yards beyond the neutral zone. (a) Both blocks are above the waist. (b) One block is above the waist and the other at the knee. RULING: (a) Legal blocks. (b) Foul, chop block.
V. After snapping the ball, snapper A54 brushes by nose guard B62 on his way to block a linebacker. A54 makes slight contact with B62, or B62 reaches out and uses his arm to initiate contact with A54. While B62 and A54 are in contact, right guard A68 blocks B62 at the knee from the front. RULING: Legal. A54 is not blocking B62. The incidental contact or B62’s initiating contact does not constitute part of a combination block, and hence there is no chop block.
Contact Against the Snapper—ARTICLE 14
Approved Ruling 9-1-14
I. A10 is in a shotgun-type formation 7-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> yards behind the snapper, who has his head down and is looking backward through his legs. Immediately after the snap, nose guard B55 charges directly at the snapper and contacts him by pushing him backward. RULING: Legal. The snapper is not afforded any special protection because Team A is not in a scrimmage kick formation, since A10 is not at least 10 yards deep (Rule 2-16-10). The snapper does have the usual protection against any personal foul for unnecessary roughness.
II. Team A is in a scrimmage kick formation with the punter 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Immediately after the snap, nose guard B55 charges directly at the snapper, contacts him, and drives him backward. The ball is snapped to an upback three yards behind the scrimmage line or to the potential kicker, who instead runs with or passes the ball. RULING: Foul. Penalty—15 yards and automatic first down. The snapper may not be contacted until one second has elapsed after the snap when Team A is in a scrimmage kick formation.
III. Immediately after the snap, with Team A in a scrimmage kick formation, noseguard B71 attempts to “shoot the gap” between the snapper and the adjacent lineman. B71’s initial legal contact is with the lineman next to the snapper. RULING: Legal. Incidental contact with the snapper after this initial legal contact is not a foul (Rule 2-16-10).
Horse Collar Tackle—ARTICLE 15
Approved Ruling 9-1-15
I. As ball carrier A20 races down field near the sideline, defender B56 grabs him from behind by the back of the jersey at the collar or by the collar of his shoulder pad. B56 continues with this contact for several yards but A20 does not go to the ground until tackled by another defender. RULING: Legal play. B56 did not foul because he did not immediately pull A20 down.
Roughing or Running Into Kicker or Holder—ARTICLE 16
Approved Ruling 9-1-16
I. A1 catches a long snap and plans to punt from behind his line of scrimmage but misses the ball, which falls to the ground. A1 is then contacted by B1. RULING: Team A fumble. No foul by B1. There is no kicker until the ball is kicked.
II. A1 kicks the ball, after which B1, unable to stop his attempt to block the kick, runs into the kicker or holder. RULING: Penalty—Five yards from the previous spot. Roughing and 15 yards and first down if in question as to whether the foul is “running into’’ or “roughing.’’
III. A1, from a nonscrimmage kick formation, makes a quick, unexpected kick so suddenly that B1 cannot avoid contact. RULING: This is not roughing or running into the kicker since the rule applies only when it is obvious that a kick will be made.
IV. B1 runs into player A1, who has kicked the ball and has had a reasonable time to regain his balance. RULING: Not a foul by B1 unless ruled as running into or throwing himself against an opponent obviously out of the play (Rule 9-1-12).
V. After B1 runs into the kicker, kicker A25 simulates being roughed. RULING: Offsetting fouls.
VI. Team A is in a scrimmage kick formation. Punter A1 moves laterally two or three steps to recover a faulty snap, or recovers a snap that went over his head, and then kicks the ball. B2 contacts A1 in an unsuccessful attempt to block the kick. RULING: A1 does not automatically lose his protection in either case unless he carries the ball outside the tackle box. While in the tackle box A1 is entitled to protection as in any other kicking situation. When it becomes obvious that A1 intends to kick in a normal punting position, defensive players must avoid him after he kicks the ball.
VII. Punter A22 is 15 yards behind the neutral zone when he catches the long snap, sprints to his right at an angle toward the line of scrimmage, and runs outside the tackle box. He then stops and punts the ball, and is immediately hit by a diving B89. RULING: Legal play, no foul by B89. A22 loses his roughing or running-into protection by carrying the ball outside the tackle box.
Continued Participation Without Helmet—ARTICLE 17
Approved Ruling 9-1-17
I. During a down B55’s helmet comes off without a helmet foul by Team A. B55 immediately picks up his helmet, puts it on and continues to chase the ball carrier. RULING: Personal foul by B55 for continuing to participate after losing his helmet. The clock stops at the end of the down and B55 must leave the game for the next down. (Rule 3-3-9)
Section 2. Unsportsmanlike Conduct Fouls
Unsportsmanlike Acts—ARTICLE 1
Approved Ruling 9-2-1
I. Team B scores a touchdown on a kickoff return, and substitutes from the Team B area, with no intention of entering the game, run to the end zone to congratulate the ball carrier. RULING: Unsportsmanlike act. Penalty—15 yards, enforced on the try or the succeeding kickoff. Officials should note the numbers of the offending players, for possible disqualification later in the game upon committing a second unsportsmanlike conduct foul (9-2-1-a-Penalty).
II. Third and 15 at the B-20. Eligible A88 catches a pass at the B-18 and heads for the goal line. At the B-10 he goes into a “goose step” and continues this action as he crosses the goal line. RULING: Live-ball foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. Fifteen-yard penalty enforced at the spot of the foul, which is the B-10, and repeat third down. Third and 20 at the B-25.
III. Second and 5 at the B-40. Back A22 takes a backward pass from the quarterback, circles right end, and heads for the goal line. Guard A66, who had pulled out to lead the play, legally blocks B90 to the ground and then stands over him at the B-30 taunting and screaming obscenities. This draws a flag from the head linesman, when A22 is at the B-10 before continuing into the end zone. RULING: Live-ball foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. Fifteen- yard penalty enforced at the spot of the foul, which is the B-30, and repeat second down. Second and 10 at the B-45.
IV. Third and 15 at the B-20. Eligible A88 catches a pass at the B-18 and heads for the goal line. Very close to the goal line he dives into the end zone, with no Team B player closer than about 10 yards. The field judge is uncertain of the exact spot where A88 started his diving action. RULING: Foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. Administer as a dead-ball foul: The touchdown counts and the penalty is enforced on the try or the succeeding kickoff.
V. Second and seven at the B-30. Nose guard B55 is lined up in the neutral zone at the snap. Back A22 takes the ball on a quick play up the middle, bursts into the open, and at the B-10 he turns around prances backward into the end zone. The head linesman and the line judge both have flags for the offside foul, and the back judge drops his flag for the action by A22. RULING: Offsetting fouls, repeat the down. Second and seven at the B-30.
VI. First and 10 at the 50. The quarterback pitches out to running back A44 who circles right end and races toward the goal line. The line judge trailing the play flags linebacker B57 for screaming obscenities at him, complaining that he was held by the tight end. A44 scores a touchdown. RULING: Live–ball unsportsmanlike conduct against B57. The penalty carries over to either the try or the kickoff, at the option of Team A.
VII. Third and 15 at the A-45. A12 drops back to pass and is sacked by tackle B77 for a 10-yard loss. B77 leaps to his feet, beats his chest, stands over A12 and taunts him, and showboats to the crowd, drawing flags from the referee and the line judge. RULING: Dead- ball unsportsmanlike conduct by B77. Fifteen-yard penalty at the dead-ball spot plus automatic first down. First and 10 for Team A at the 50.
VIII. Safety B33 intercepts a pass at the B-10 and returns for a touchdown. As he is coming down the sideline covering the play the line judge drops his flag after he runs into the Team B head coach who is just on the field of play near the B-40. RULING: Although this is a foul that takes place while the ball is alive, it is treated as a dead-ball foul against the team because it is committed by a non-player. The touchdown counts and the 15-yard penalty is enforced on the try or the succeeding kickoff.
IX. Second and five at the A-45. Ball carrier A33 breaks out into the open and has a clear path to the goal line. At the B-2 he suddenly makes a sharp left turn and trots along the B-2 as the Team B players begin to catch up to him. He then carries the ball into the end zone. A33 next runs to the stands and begins to exchange “high-fives” with the fans.RULING: No score. A33 is charged with two fouls for unsportsmanlike conduct, one live-ball and the other dead-ball. Both 15-yard penalties are enforced and A33 is ejected from the game. First and 10 for Team A at the B-32. (Rule 9-2-6)
X. After the ball carrier is tackled, A55 and B73 engage in a scuffle such that officials have to separate them and throw flags. Both A55 and B73 are charged with dead-ball personal fouls. RULING: Offsetting dead-ball fouls. Each player is also charged with an unsportsmanlike conduct foul which counts toward the two such fouls leading to automatic disqualification. The referee announces either the first or second unsportsmanlike conduct foul for A55 and B73.
XI. During the play, the ball carrier fumbles and several players dive for the ball. B55 grabs A33 and slings him off the pile. RULING: B55 is charged with a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. 15 yards and automatic first down. The referee announces that this is either the first or second unsportsmanlike conduct foul against B55. If it is the second, B55 is disqualified from the game.
XII. During a dead-ball time, a head coach or an assistant coach is flagged for coming out to the numbers and cursing the officials in a loud and abusive manner. RULING: The officials charge either the head coach or the assistant coach with a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. The referee announces that this is either the first or second unsportsmanlike conduct foul against the coach in question. If it is the second, the coach in question is disqualified from the game.
Unfair Tactics—ARTICLE 2
Approved Ruling 9-2-2
I. After the ball is ready for play, Team A goes into a formation with two players split wide on both sides of the snapper and two other Team A linemen adjacent to the snapper. No more than four players are legally in the backfield. Team A sends in two substitutes, who take positions on the line of scrimmage adjacent to the two split offensive linemen on the opposite side of the field of play from their team bench. This leaves Team A with nine players on the line of scrimmage and four backfield players all legally in position. Immediately and before the snap, two Team A linemen nearest their team’s bench leave the field of play and are off at the snap. Seven players are on the line of scrimmage, five of whom are Team A linemen numbered 50 to 79. RULING: Penalty—15 yards from the previous spot. This is a simulated replacement of a player to confuse the opponents.
II. On fourth down at Team B’s 12-yard line, A1 enters the field of play with a kicking shoe while his 11 teammates are in the huddle. A1 kneels and measures the distance from the neutral zone to the kicking spot. While his teammates are leaving the huddle, A1 leaves the field of play with the shoe. Team A quickly runs a play from scrimmage. RULING: Team A foul. Penalty—15 yards from the previous spot. There shall be no simulated replacement of a player to confuse the opponents, and a player who communicates must remain in the game for one down.
III. A1 leaves the field of play during a down. Team A huddles with 10 players. Substitute A12 enters, and A2 simulates leaving the field but sets near the sideline for a “hide-out’’ pass. RULING: Penalty—15 yards from the previous spot. This is a simulated replacement of a player to confuse opponents.
IV. While a team is legally set to attempt a field goal, the potential holder for the kick goes toward his team area asking for a shoe. A shoe is thrown on the field and the player, in motion toward his team area, turns toward the goal line. The ball is snapped to the player in the kicking position, who throws a pass to the player who had turned up field after asking for a shoe. RULING: Penalty—15 yards from the previous spot.
V. Team A is lined up in scrimmage kick formation and has been set for one second. One of the offensive backs shouts to and motions to A40, the blocker on the right wing, to get off the field. At the snap, A40 is in legal motion toward his sideline. A40 turns downfield and becomes a pass receiver. RULING: Penalty—15 yards from the previous spot. This is a tactic associated with the substitution process to deceive opponents.
VI. After the down is over, Team A sends in three substitutes, and three players begin to leave the field. A88, who participated in the previous play, trails the three replaced players toward the Team A sideline. The three replaced players continue into the team area, but A88 stops and sets up on the line of scrimmage very close to the sideline. After the ball is snapped A88 runs down the sideline and catches a forward pass. RULING: Team A at the snap, unsportsmanlike conduct for unfair tactics: using the substitution process to deceive the opponents. Live-ball foul. Penalty: 15 yards at the previous spot.
Unfair Acts—ARTICLE 3
Approved Ruling 9-2-3
I. After the ball is ready for play and the umpire is in his regular position, Team A quickly replaces some players with substitutes, gets set for the required one second and snaps the ball. The umpire is attempting to get to the ball to allow the defense to match up, but he is unable to prevent the snap. RULING: The play is shut down, the game clock is stopped and the defense is allowed to substitute in response to Team A’s late substitutions. No foul. The play clock is set to 25 seconds and starts on the ready-for-play signal. The game clock starts on the ready-for-play signal or the snap, depending on its condition when play was stopped. The referee informs the Team A head coach that any subsequent such actions will result in a foul against the team for unsportsmanlike conduct. (Rule 3-5-2)
Game Administration and Sideline Interference—ARTICLE 5
Approved Ruling 9-2-5
I. On the opening kickoff, B22 catches the kick at his goal line and returns the ball down the sideline on Team B’s side of the field. As he moves down the sideline officiating the play, the side judge either runs into or must run around a Team B coach or squad member in the restricted area (“the white”). B22 is driven out of bounds at the A-20. RULING: Either situation is physical interference with an official during the play. No warning. Team B foul for unsportsmanlike conduct administered as a dead-ball foul. After the 15-yard penalty, Team B will have first and 10 at the A-35.
Section 3. Blocking, Use of Hand and Arm
Interfering for or Helping the Ball Carrier or Passer—ARTICLE 2
Approved Ruling 9-3-2
I. In trying to gain yardage, ball carrier A44 is slowed by defensive players attempting to make the tackle. Back A22 (a) puts his hands on the buttocks of A44 and pushes him forward; (b) pushes the pile of teammates who begin to surround A44; &copy; grabs the arm of A44 and tries to pull him forward for more yardage. RULING: (a) and (b) Legal. It is not a foul to push the ball carrier or the pile. &copy; Foul for assisting the runner. 5-yard penalty with three-and-one enforcement. (Rule 9-3-2-b)
Holding and Use of Hands or Arms: Offense—ARTICLE 3
Approved Ruling 9-3-3
I. A6 is advancing the ball. During the run, A12 vigorously blocks B2 with a rough push in the back above the waist. RULING: Illegal block in the back. Penalty—10 yards.
II. A teammate of the passer or ball carrier, while charging across the neutral zone, contacts an opponent with his hands and arms not parallel to the ground or his hands cupped or closed but with the palms not facing the opponent. RULING: Legal use of hands.
III. A teammate of the passer or ball carrier, behind the neutral zone, has his arms parallel to the ground and contacts an opponent above the shoulders. RULING: Illegal use of hands. Penalty—10 yards or 15 yards for personal foul, previous-spot enforcement. Safety if the foul occurs behind Team A’s goal line.
IV. A teammate of the passer or ball carrier delivers a blow with the hand(s) closed to an opponent below the shoulders. RULING: Personal foul. Penalty—15 yards. Enforce at the previous spot if foul occurs behind the neutral zone. Safety if the foul occurs behind Team A’s goal line.
V. A2’s hands contact defensive player B2 in a legal block. B2 spins to avoid blocker A2, whose hands then contact B2’s back. RULING: Legal block.
VI. A2’s hands contact defensive player B2’s back when B2 spins to avoid A2. A2 keeps his hands on B2’s back while B2 advances toward the passer. RULING: Legal block.
VII. A2’s hands contact defensive player B2 when B2 spins to avoid blocker A2, whose hands then contact B2’s back. After A2’s hands lose contact with B2, A2 advances and pushes B2 in the back. RULING: Illegal block in the back. Penalty—10 yards. Enforce at the previous spot if foul occurs behind the neutral zone (Rule 2-3-4). Safety if the foul occurs behind Team A’s goal line.
VIII. A1 in, beyond or behind the neutral zone contacts an opponent with an open hand or with hands closed or cupped and palms not facing the opponent. RULING: Legal block.
IX. A12 takes the snap and retreats to pass. Defensive end B95 gets past tackle A75 and is about to tackle A12, who is still inside the tackle box. A75 pushes B95 in the back at the numbers to prevent him from making the tackle. A12’s pass is complete for a touchdown. RULING: Touchdown counts. No foul by A75. Such actions involving pass protection while the passer remains inside the tackle box are within the spirit of the exception to Rule 9-3-6 and are thus legal.
Use of Hands or Arms by Defense: Passing Downs—ARTICLE 5
Approved Ruling 9-3-5
I. Before a legal forward pass that crosses the neutral zone is thrown, Team B holds eligible A1, who is beyond the neutral zone. RULING: Team B foul, holding. Penalty—10 yards and first down, previous- spot enforcement.
Section 4. Batting and Kicking
Batting a Loose Ball—ARTICLE 1
Approved Ruling 9-4-1
I. Team A attempts a field goal from Team B’s 30-yard line. A Team B player in the end zone leaps above the crossbar and bats the ball in flight. The ball goes into the end zone and is recovered by Team A. RULING: Foul for batting the ball in the end zone. The result of the play is a touchdown.
II. Team A attempts a field goal from Team B’s 30-yard line. A Team B player in the end zone leaps above the crossbar and bats the ball in flight. The ball goes into the end zone and is recovered by Team B. RULING: Foul for batting the ball in the end zone. The result of the play is a touchback. Safety if penalty is accepted.
III. Team A attempts a field goal from Team B’s 30-yard line. A Team B player in the end zone leaps above the crossbar and bats the ball in flight. The ball goes into the field of play. RULING: Foul for batting the ball in the end zone. During regulation play, postscrimmage kick enforcement gives a safety by penalty. The ball remains alive, and normal scrimmage kick rules apply. Team A may elect the result of the play. If Team A recovers, does not score and accepts the penalty, or if the play occurs in an extra period, enforcement is at the previous spot.
IV. Team A attempts a place kick on the try. A Team B player in the end zone leaps above the crossbar and bats the ball in flight. The ball goes out of bounds in the end zone. RULING: Foul for batting the ball in the end zone. Penalty—Half the distance from the previous spot. Postscrimmage kick rules do not apply on the try (Rule 10-2-3).
V. Team A attempts a place kick on the try. A Team B player in the end zone leaps above the crossbar and bats the ball in flight. The ball goes into the end zone and is recovered by Team A. RULING: Foul for batting the ball in the end zone. Team A may decline the penalty and scores two points.
VI. Team A attempts a field goal, and B23, in the end zone, goes above the crossbar and catches the ball. RULING: Legal play.
VII. Team A’s fumble in flight is batted forward by B1, and the ball goes out of bounds behind Team A’s goal line. RULING: Safety. Batting a fumble in flight does not add a new impetus (Rule 8-7-2-b). Team B foul. Penalty—10 yards.
VIII. Team A’s backward pass in flight is batted by B1, and the ball goes out of bounds behind Team A’s goal line. RULING: Safety. A pass may be batted in any direction and the impetus is charged to Team A’s pass (Rule 8-5-1-a).
IX. A free kick is muffed in flight by a Team B player in his end zone. While the ball is loose in the end zone, a Team B player bats the ball out of the end zone. RULING: The result of the play is a touchback. Team B foul for illegally batting a ball in the end zone. Penalty—10 yards from the previous spot.
X. After intercepting a legal forward pass at the B-20, B1 fumbles at the B-38. At the B-30, B2 illegally bats the loose ball, which goes forward and out of bounds. RULING: Team B foul. Penalty—10 yards from the spot of the foul. Team B’s ball, first and 10 at the 20-yard line. No loss of down is included in the penalty since Team B is awarded a new series after the penalty enforcement (Rule 5-1-1- e-1).
XI. Team A is prepared to kick off. The ball is on the tee and the referee has signaled it ready for play. As the kicker approaches the ball it begins to roll off the tee just as he starts his kicking motion. The kicker follows through and kicks the ball as it continues to roll off or near the tee. RULING: No foul. This is not a violation of either 9-4-4 or 9-2-1-a-2-a. The officials should stop play and have the teams line up for a new kickoff. If weather conditions dictate, Team A should have a player hold the ball on the tee.
Illegally Kicking Ball—ARTICLE 4
Approved Ruling 9-4-4
I. Fourth and eight at the A-48. From a scrimmage kick formation, A32 punts the ball to the B-7 where it hits B25 on the leg. As the ball rolls along the ground, B25 then kicks it at the B-4 to prevent Team A from recovering. The ball bounces into Team B’s end zone and over the end line. RULING: The result of the play is a safety, as B25’s kicking the ball provides new impetus. Foul by B25 for illegally kicking the ball. Team A may decline the penalty and take the two points, or accept the penalty. The foul by B25 is governed by postscrimmage kick rules, so the accepted penalty would give Team B the ball at the B-2, first down and 10. (Rules 8-5-1-a and 8-7-2-b)</p>
