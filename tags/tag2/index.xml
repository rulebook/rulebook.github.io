      <description>Revised April 2016
A concussion is a brain injury that is most commonly caused by a blow to the head or trunk, or by the head or body forcefully impacting the ground. Concussions most commonly occur without loss of consciousness. Typically, there are subtle indications that a concussion has occurred, such as the student-athlete shaking his head, stumbling, or appearing dazed or stunned.
Game officials are often in a best position to observe student-athletes up-close, and may be the first to notice the unusual behaviors that indicate a concussion may be present.</description>

      <description>NCAA Football Rules and Interpretations have been designated as either administrative rules or conduct rules. Typically, administrative rules are those dealing with preparation for the contest. Conduct rules are those that have to do directly with the playing of the contest. Some administrative rules (as indicated) may be altered by the mutual consent of the competing institutions. Others (as indicated) are unalterable. No conduct rule may be changed by mutual consent.</description>

      <description>Football is an aggressive, rugged contact sport. Only the highest standards of sportsmanship and conduct are expected of players, coaches and others associated with the game. There is no place for unfair tactics, unsportsmanlike conduct or maneuvers deliberately designed to inflict injury. The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) Code of Ethics states: a. The Football Code shall be an integral part of this code of ethics and should be carefully read and observed.</description>

      <description>전통적으로 미식축구는 교육활동의 중요한 한 분야를 담당하고 있다. 그러므로 선수, 코치, 그 외의 경기관계자에 대해서는 최고의 스포츠맨십과 행동이 요구된다.
미식축구는 격렬하고 힘이 넘치며, 신체를 부딪치는 운동이다. 부정한 전술, 스포츠맨답지 않은 행위, 고의로 상대선수를 다치게 하는 행위는 절대로 허용되지 않는다.
a. 미식축구의 강령은 불가결한 것으로 주의 깊게 읽고 지켜야 한다. b. 본 규칙을 왜곡하거나 무시하여 이익을 얻고자 하는 것은 코치나 선수로서 미식축구에 관한 자격을 잃는 것이다. 수년에 걸쳐 규칙위원회는 규칙과 적절한 벌칙에 따라 여러 가지 불필요한 난폭한 행위, 부정한 전술, 스포츠맨답지 않은 행위를 금지하려고 노력해 왔다.</description>

      <description>NCAA Football Rules Committee Adopted February 2009
 After reviewing a number of plays involving unsportsmanlike conduct, the committee is firm in its support of the unsportsmanlike conduct rules as they currently are written and officiated. Many of these fouls deal with players who inappropriately draw attention to themselves in a premeditated, excessive or prolonged manner. Players should be taught the discipline that reinforces football as a team game. The rules committee reminds head coaches of their responsibility for the behavior of their players before and after, as well as during, the game.</description>

      <description>The NCAA Football Rules Committee has extraordinary pride in the Football Code, which was introduced in 1916 and has been updated several times. These guidelines form a harmony of agreement among coaches, players, game officials and administrators that places each contest in an environment of fairness and sportsmanship. It is noted that the Code emphasizes the following unethical practices: “Using the helmet as a weapon. The helmet is for protection of the player&amp;hellip;” and “players and coaches should emphasize the elimination of targeting and initiating contact against a defenseless opponent and/or with the crown of the helmet.</description>

      <description>규칙위원회는 풋볼의 강령을 도입한 이래 매년 수정과 개정하여 왔으며 이것은 최고 수준의 윤리 규정이다. 여기에는 코치, 선수, 심판, 운영관계자의 협조와 합의를 기초로 형성되고 경기의 공평성과 품위를 지키기 위한 지침이 기록되어 있다. 요강이 정한 행동의 하나로 ‘풋볼 헬멧을 무기로 사용하는 것’이 게재되어 있다.
‘헬멧은 선수의 보호를 위한 것’이며, 선수와 코치와 심판은 타기팅하여 헬멧의 상단으로 접촉하는 것이나 무방비한 선수에 대해 목이나 머리에의 접촉을 금지하는 것을 목표로 하여야 한다. 미식축구 관계자 전원이 다음의 기본 윤리 규정을 잘 지켜서 전통 있는 이 스포츠의 장래를 유익하게 만들어 가기를 원한다.</description>
